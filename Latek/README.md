<h1>Latek</h1>

<p>In this challenge we have no source code provided but the presentation of the challenge can give us a clue on a language to use therefore a potential vulnerability : </p>

<p><i>"bryanguo (not associated with the ctf), keeps saying it's pronouced <B>latek not latex </B>like the glove material. anyways i made this simple app so he stops paying for overleaf"</i></p>

<p>With the hint given in the presentation, we can already guess that the web server uses the language <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX"><B>LaTex</B></a>
 So potentially the vulnerability to be exploited is a LaTex injection.</p>
